* BACKEND and FRONTEND - A multi-module application uses the same document root for more than one module.

### Installing the module
If you want to install a new module, you need using the terminal run the following command
```bash
$ php apps/cli.php modules create modulename
```
**modulename** - replace it with the name of the module

For example, after executing the commands below in a terminal
```bash
$ php apps/cli.php modules create catalog
```
In the terminal, we see the report module installation
```bash
$ php apps/cli.php modules create catalog
Do you really want to install the module catalog?  Type 'yes' to continue: yes

Thank you, continuing...

```
After installing our new module will be immediately available at http://site.com/catalog

```bash
$ php apps/cli.php modules create $nameModule $prefixRouter $hostName
```
